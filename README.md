## Introduction

**nf-core/lightsheetrecon** is a bioimage analysis pipeline that reconstructs large microscopy image volumes. It ingests raw images in CZI format from Zeiss Lightsheet microscopes, computes flatfield correction and tile stitching, and outputs a multi-resolution image pyramid in N5 format. In the future this pipeline will support additional input formats as well as deconvolution and other image processing methods.

1. Spin up a Spark cluster if configured
2. Read image metadata from MVL metadata file ([stitching-spark](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/stitching-spark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/janelia/stitching/ParseCZITilesMetadata.java))
3. Convert the CZI images to N5 format ([stitching-spark](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/stitching-spark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/janelia/stitching/ConvertCZITilesToN5Spark.java))
4. Compute flatfield correction ([stitching-spark](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/stitching-spark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/janelia/flatfield/FlatfieldCorrection.java))
5. Compute stitching ([stitching-spark](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/stitching-spark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/janelia/stitching/PipelineStitchingStepExecutor.java))
6. Fuse files and export to N5 ([stitching-spark](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/stitching-spark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/janelia/stitching/PipelineFusionStepExecutor.java))
7. Stop Spark cluster if configured

## Usage

:::note
If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.
:::

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
id,filename,pattern
LHA3_R3_tiny,LHA3_R3_small.czi,LHA3_R3_small.czi
LHA3_R3_tiny,LHA3_R3_tiny.mvl,
LHA3_R5_tiny,LHA3_R5_small.czi,LHA3_R5_small.czi
LHA3_R5_tiny,LHA3_R5_tiny.mvl,
```

Each row represents a file in the input data set. The identifier (`id`) groups files together into acquisition rounds. In the example above, each acquisition is a single CZI file containing all of the tiles and channels, and an MVL file containing the acquisition metadata (e.g. stage coordinates for each tile.)

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/lightsheetrecon \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

:::warning
Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
:::

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/lightsheetrecon/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/lightsheetrecon/parameters).

## Credits

The [stitching-spark tools](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/stitching-spark) used in this pipeline were developed by the [Saalfeld Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/saalfeld-lab) at Janelia Research Campus.

The modules for running Spark clusters on Nextflow were originally prototyped by [Cristian Goina](https://github.com/cgoina).

The nf-core/lightsheetrecon pipeline was originally constructed by [Konrad Rokicki](https://github.com/krokicki).

The workflow diagram is based on the SVG source from the [cutandrun](https://github.com/nf-core/cutandrun/) pipeline.
